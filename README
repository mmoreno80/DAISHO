Welcome to DAISHO GNU/Linux

DAISHO GNU/Linux is a lightweigth distribution, oriented to a basic
environment to do some fun. It doesn't pretend to be user friendly,
neither to be a complete distribution. The main idea behind this
proyect, is to implement a GNU/Linux distribution closed to the *BSD
flavours and to follow the KISS principle.

At this point, it has a simple package management software which
handles basic package's construction, installation, and removal (and
others). They don't provide with dependences track, but help to
construct and mantain they system.

If you want to help or ask anything, drop me an email to mmoreno80 at
gmail dot com. I'm going to be glad to reply you back.

Have fun!
